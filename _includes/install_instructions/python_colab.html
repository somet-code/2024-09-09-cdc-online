Remove the third paragraph if the workshop will teach Python
using something other than the Jupyter Notebook. Details at

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://python.org" target="_blank">Python</a> is a popular language for research computing,
    and great fo rgeneral-purpose programming as well. We will use
    <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Colaboratory</a> to
    write and execute Python code using notebooks.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will need to have a Google account and a device that can access Google Colaboratory and
    <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> in a reasonably up-to-date
    major browser of your choice. Google Colab has been tested with the latest versons of Google Chrome,
    Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari browsers and therefore these are recommended for use.
