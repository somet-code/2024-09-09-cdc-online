  <h3>Python</h3>

    <a href="https://python.org" target="_blank">Python</a> is a popular language for research computing,
    and great fo rgeneral-purpose programming as well. We will use
    <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Colaboratory</a> to
    write and execute Python code using notebooks. You will need to have a Google account and
    a device that can access Google Colaboratory and
    <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> in a browser of your choice.
